Goal : 


1. goal is to perform sentiment analysis of Prescription Drug Reviews . The dataset is from Druglib  & Kaggle 
2. There are various formulations and brands for   Prescription drugs available in the market  for each condition .Physicians generally choose a formulation based the ob various factors like interactions with other drugs the patient is already taking , effectiveness of the formulation, side effects  and so on.. 
3.  The tool i am developing will help doctors understand sentiment related to the reviews  when prescribing medications . Most of the Physicians have understanding of the formulations of the drugs .however they donâ€™t have wholistic view of the drugs effectiveness, once the Prescription has been prescribed . This tool will help them bridge that Gap.
